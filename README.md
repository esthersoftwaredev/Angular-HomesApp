# Homes App - [VIEW LIVE](https://homesapp.monacodelisa.com/)

## watch the [Angular Tutorials](https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app) to build a similar app

### Since I already added the locations list to the simple [Node.js & Express REST API](https://dummyrestapi.netlify.app/locations) that I developed, I thought it might be nice to have the matching frontend to go along.

### This is not my first app and I am not following every single instruction from the tutorial but I am keeping the app fairly similar.

## What I added:
- ### REST API to serve the location data
- ### Angular v17 - new control flow and other adjustments
- ### Angular Material ![ angular material logo ](/src/assets/images/icons/angular-material-16x16.png "Angular Material")
- ### Form Validation with \<mat-error> - [adjusted this version](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-17-reactive-form-validation?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.css)
- ### my styling
- ### Netlify deployment synced with GitHub
